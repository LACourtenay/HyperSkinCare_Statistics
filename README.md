This code has been designed for the open-source free R programming languages.

This code was designed and prepared for the study by:
<b> Courtenay, L.A.; González-Aguilera, D.; Lagüela, S.; Del Pozo, S.; Ruiz-Mendez, C.; Barbero-García, I.; Román-Curto, C.; Cañueto, J.;
Santos-Durán, C.; Cardeñozo-Álvarez, M.E.; Roncero-Riesco, M.; Hernandez-Lopez, D.; Guerrero-Sevilla, D.; Rodríguez-Gonzalvez, P. (Accepted)
Hyperspectral Imaging and Robust Statistics in Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Analysis. Submitted to Biomedical Optics Express. </b>

All of the research included within the present repository was collected as part of the <b> HYPER-SKINCARE </b> research project, funded by the
Junta de Castilla y Leon with project reference number: GRS 1837/A/18.

The present repository contains:

* <b> Dataset of Hyperspectral Signatures </b>
    * Comma delimited table containing all the hyperspectral signatures obtained from cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) patients,
    as well as Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) patients.
    * Patient ID's have been included so as to differentiate between signatures obtained from the same patients, nevertheless, so as to ensure patient animosity, no further
    information has or will be provided.
* <b> Sensor Band Information </b>
    * A list of each of the Headwall Nano-Hyperspec's bands, their frequencies, and corresponding colours of visible light where applicable.
* <b> Statistical Results </b>
    * A folder containing all of the statistical results and values calculated for the present study, and consequently used to create the associated manuscipt/article.
* <b> R Code for Robust Statistical Analysis </b>
    * All the R code used to process the corresponding hyperspectral signatures and extract the statistical results
    * All of the code used to produce graphs and figures included within the study
